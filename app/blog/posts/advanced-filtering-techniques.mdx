With thousands of yield opportunities available in the crypto market, finding the best ones can feel overwhelming. That’s where advanced filtering comes into play. By using strategic filters, you can quickly narrow down options and make smarter investment choices.

This article will guide you through the top filtering techniques to optimize your crypto yields.

## Filtering by Chain and Token

One of the simplest yet most effective filters is by chain and token. Whether you’re focused on Ethereum, Solana, or newer blockchains like Sui, filtering by chain can help you find opportunities that align with your investment strategy.

### Token-Specific Yields

If you’re holding a specific token like USDC or MATIC, use filters to find yield opportunities that maximize your returns on those assets. This approach helps you make the most of your existing portfolio.

## Using APY Ranges to Set Targets

Setting an APY range allows you to filter out opportunities that are either too risky (with unsustainably high APYs) or not lucrative enough. Aim for a balance between risk and reward based on your financial goals.

### Avoiding APY Traps

- **Unsustainable Yields**: If an APY seems too good to be true, it probably is. Use historical APY data to gauge stability.
- **Short-Term vs. Long-Term**: Decide whether you want quick returns or are comfortable with a long-term staking commitment.

## Risk Filtering for Safer Investments

APY List’s risk assessment tools can filter opportunities based on risk level, from low-risk stablecoin pools to high-risk, high-reward farming projects. This feature is invaluable for investors who prioritize security.

### Combining Filters for Precision

For the best results, combine multiple filters. For example, use both APY range and risk level filters to find pools that offer a good balance between returns and safety.
